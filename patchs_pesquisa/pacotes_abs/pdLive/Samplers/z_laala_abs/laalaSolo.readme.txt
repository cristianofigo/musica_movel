Thanks for trying out laalaSolo. Laala is kind of a slicer / granulizer / ambience
creator. Apparently it works well for voice, instrument and field-recording samples. I 
can't seem to get it to do something decent with beat samples but maybe you can.

There's a large number of sliders, numbers and radios and many produce interesting 
sound in conjunction with eachother. (For now) i'm not going to give a detailed 
explanation what each widget does, but i'll give you a brief of what I usually do
with it. If things still remain unclear you can always reach me direct at domxh@yhoo.com
or on the pd forum puredata.hurleur.com). If you would create enhanced or altered
version of laala (feel free to do so) or would record any music with it, feel free to
let me now at domxh@yahoo.com.

Enjoy it,

Laala needs a sample to work with, so here we go :

- in the "SMP" section click "open" to load a sample
- click run or press SPACE to start playing. The tempo is by default set to 250 (the big
 orange number in the middle).
 - in the "MIX" section move the "L" slider to hear laala output (the two blue "D" sliders
  route the signal to the blue delay modules)
  
Now you should have a basic sound running. What happens now is that the sample is sliced
in 16 parts. This is done by the "STEPS" number in the STEPS./.TIME section. Laala has 16
internal samplers to play slices. These samplers can be turned of in the (green) LET_OUT 
section. 
	- The number of samplers used is the big green number. 
	- the green hradio's are presets (implemented incomplete)
	
Grey "SHAPE" section is actually an envelope for each sampler and grey hradio is are again
presets. actually all radio strips are preset systems for the module they belong to.

- the pink "FROM" and "TO" sliders limits the range of the sample used. When crossed the
seekwenser runs backwards over the sample


To use the TIME_SLIDER do the following :
	- click the orange FROM and TO bangs. These will borrow the current tempo value so that
	  both yellow numbers have now the current tempo
	- now change the TO number (e.g. set it from 250 to 434 something), set the SLIDE_TIME to
	  a few second and press the big orange "SLIDE" bang and head how the current tempo slides
	  from the FROM time to the TO time in SLIDE_TIME seconds and back.
	- if you set the "HOLD_TIME" the slider will wait this number of second when at the TO value
	  and then slide back to the FROM_TIME
	
So now we've covered some of the time options, a bit more about the STEPS/TIME section. This actually
is the heart of the slicer :

	- the big yellow toggle makes the slicer run or freeze (when frozen, you can use the olive slider
	  bellow the sample view to manually change its position)
	- sometimes the internal counter of the slicer goes berzerk, if this happens (the slicer doesn't
	seem to move) press the yellow "R" bang
	- the number of slices is defined in the yellow "STEPS" number. 
	- with the very large yellow slider you can quickly increase to number of steps to 2000.
	- the "DIR" radio sets the direction of the slicer
	- another way to alter the number of steps is with the "X" and "/" bangs. When you press the "X"
	the number of steps is doubled and the tempo halved (the "/" does the opposite).
	- a large number of steps in combination with a fast tempo gives a granular character to laala.
	  (tip  : set the tempo e.g. to 12 and the nr of steps to 1000 and now play with the envelope
	   or the "LET_OUT" section to alter the character of the grains).
	
To further improve on the madness, you can route the "dry" laala signal through 2 pitch-shifter and
two delay modules (the output of the pitchshifters can also be routed to the delay modules). 
The pitchshifters are "borrowed" from the pd help (the one that uses two delay lines). Use the orange
controls to alter the pitching, the green and blue sliders to route their signal to the main output and
the delays respectively.

The two delay modules are actually the same, only the value of their gui widget are different. S-DELAY 
can be used to create short metallic delays, the L-DELAY to create long spacey ambiences. They are both
8 tap delays, their controls are :
	- LVL : their output
	- S : the speed
	- O : offset for the speed
	- W : stereo width
	- s : smears the delay
	- the blue toggle : actives an internal feedback system for denser delays
	- the horizontal blue slider routes the S-DELAY to the L-DELAY

The blue controls in the "STEPS/TIME" section actually influence the speed parameter of the L-DELAY. The
left vradio sets the speed to divisions of the tempo, the right one to multiplications. The toggle links
the delay speed to the tempo.

So, a few modules still need some explanation.

- The "LFOS" module are indeed lfo's. They can be controlled to modulate the "FROM" and "TO" sliders in the 
  "SLICER" section. The toggle turn them ON/OFF and the sliders are speed and depth. 

- When you want to play a sample with its original length, use the brown toggles in the "STEPS/TIME" section.

- You can store 8 FROM-TO-TEMPO combinations with the 4 controls located at the right in the "SLICER" section. 
  Choose a memory slot with the pink vradio, press the red bang to save the current combination of the "FROM" and
  "TO" sliders and the current tempo. Press the green bang to reload a combination. The purple "R" toggle 
  randomizes the "FROM" and "TO" sliders.
