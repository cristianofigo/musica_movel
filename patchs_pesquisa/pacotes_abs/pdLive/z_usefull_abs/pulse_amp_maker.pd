#X text 14 50 This patch allows you to draw shapes intot he array that
you can then use as an oscillating amplitude envelope. You can use
the green and blue controls to draw line segments. The purple frequency
control allows you to speed up and slow down the frequency of the oscillator.
By turning it on \, you can hear the resulting sound through a sine
tone. The phase control allows you to shift the phase of the oscillator.
;
#X text 402 151 You can save and open the nvelopes that you make. The
buttons open up save and open panels to name them.;
#X text 723 235 Use the green controls to move left and right across
the array. As you do this \, the blue controls automatically set the
value. The cyan controls below automatically create diagonal ramps
up and down \, left and right \, as labelsd.;
#X text 563 63 Use this patch witht he pulse_amp and pulse_amp_st patches
to use the envelopes that you make with other audio signals.;
#X text 16 151 Note - The frequency value is 0-2000 \, but the value
is read internally as 0hz - 20hz with floating point.;
