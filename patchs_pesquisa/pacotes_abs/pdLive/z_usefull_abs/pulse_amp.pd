#X text 75 61 This patch allows you to load amplitude env elopes that
you make with pulse_amp_maker. You route your audio signal into the
left inlet \, and hook up the outlet to your dac. You can open \, save
\, and rest the array. The purple controls are for the frequency of
the oscillating envelope \, and the grey box is for the phase. The
2nd and 3rd inlets are for routing the frequency and phase values into
the patch from another source if you want to.;
#X text 93 438 NOTE - The frequncy values are 0 - 2000 \, which are
read internally as 0hz - 20hz with floating point.;
