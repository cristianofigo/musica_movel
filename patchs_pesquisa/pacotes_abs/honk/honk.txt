----GLUE----

linvert		- inverts order of atoms of a list
listerize-fifo	- like "serialize" but for symbols, turns a list of symbols into a list, in order: first in first out
listerize-lifo	- like "serialize" but for symbols, turns a list of symbols into a list, in order: last in first out
mergerize-fifo	- turns a stream of symbols into one symbol, in order: first in first out
mergerize-lifo	- turns a stream of symbols into one symbol, in order: last in first out
nbangs		- sequence incoming bangs
prae		- glues a praefix and an input together to one list
schange		- like "change" but for symbols, outputs its input only when it changes
serialize-fifo	- like "serialize" but for any number of floats. turns a list of floats into a list, in order: first in first out
serialize-lifo	- like "serialize" but for any number of floats. turns a list of floats into a list, in order: last in first out

----TIME----
	
malibu		- counts in a certain speed
zetro		- random metronome


----MATH----

noreprand	- (almost) exactly like "random", but without repetitions. outputs random numbers in given range.
rondom		- like "random" but with offset as argument

----TABLES----

ntables		- creates a certain number of tables in subpatch


----GUI-----

bak		- like bang, but size can be given by argument
dac		- comfortable control of audio output
display		- displays a number or symbol in variable size
hamp		- comfortable horizontal potentiometer
hr		- like horizontal radio, but number of buttons can be given by argument
gop		- comfortable graph-on-parent control
hs		- horizontal slider with range as arguments
playwav		- easy sf-player
sf		- soundfile-player for different formats (wav, mp3, ogg)
tok		- like toggle, but size can be given by argument
vamp		- comfortable vertical potentiometer
vr		- like vertical radio, but number of buttons can be given by argument
vs		- vertical slider with range as arguments
vum		- quick-to-build VU-Meter


----MISC----


klist		- text-based sequencer with absolute time destinations
midi2symbol	- MIDI tone numbers to german tone name conversion


----AUDIO GLUE----

compress~	- every amplitude that lies under a certain threshold will be amplified to a reference amplitude
limit~		- every amplitude that lies over a certain threshold will be dampened to a reference amplitude
pitchshift~	- granular transposition


----AUDIO OSCILLATORS----

sinesum~	- oscillator with various partials
waveform~	- waveform oscillator (sine/saw/triangle/square/pulse/random)
